# Be Right Back (BRB) - A Chrome Extension for Google Meet

----EXPERIMENTAL----

A Chrome Extension that can be used to display a message to the other participants in a Google Meet Call: 'I will be right back.'

# Usage
On Google Meet go to Settings and select the "Virtual Image Webcam.". Now you can switch between the webcam stream and a "Be right back" Picture by clicking the Logo of the Chrome Extension. 


# Issues
The major limitation, which warrants the experimental tag, is that the webcam ceases to function when you switch tabs. The issue arises, because chrome stops the content script.
